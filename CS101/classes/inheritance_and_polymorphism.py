# ********************** Inheritance from Exception Class ********************* 

# 1. Define our own exception called OutOfStock that inherits from the Exception class.

# ********************** Overriding Methods *********************

# 1. Weâ€™ve defined two classes, Message and User 

# 2. Create an Admin class that subclasses the User class.

# ********************** Super() *********************
# super() gives a proxy object, that allows to invoke the method of the object's parent class.

class PotatoSalad:

    self.celery = celery

# ********************** Interfaces *********************

# When two classes have the same methods name and the same attributes it is said 
# that these classes implement the same interface.
# In python an interface ussually refers to the names of the methods and the arguments they take.

# 1. Define a clase

class InsurancePolicy:
  def __init__(self, price_of_item):
    self.price_of_insured_item = price_of_item

# 2. Define a subclass
class VehicleInsurance(InsurancePolicy):
  # Give VehicleInsurance a .get_rate() method that takes self as a parameter. Return .001 multiplied by the price of the vehicle.
  def get_rate(self):
    return 0.001 * self.price_of_insured_item

# 3. Define another subclass
# Give VehicleInsurance a .get_rate() method that takes self as a parameter. Return .00005 multiplied by the price of the vehicle.
class HomeInsurance(InsurancePolicy):
  def get_rate(self):
    return 0.00005 * self.price_of_insured_item


# ********************** Polimorphism *********************

# Polymorphism is the term used to describe the same syntax (or method) 
# doing different actions depending on the type of data.

# ******************** Dunder Methods **********************
